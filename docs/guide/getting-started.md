# Getting Started {#getting-started}

**Img Mapper** is an open-source library that enables developers to create **interactive, clickable, and highlightable regions on images**.

It simplifies building visual interfaces like seat maps, product previews, floor plans, or educational diagrams, anywhere you want users to interact directly with parts of an image.

The library provides a **declarative API** to define areas using coordinate data, manage hover and click events, and style highlighted zones.
It is available for both **React** and **Vue**, ensuring a consistent experience across frameworks.
